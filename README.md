# Description
  Built a timed quiz that included multiple choice questions. Once a user clicks on an answer and it is correct the quiz continues unto the next question. If the user chooses the wrong answer the timer decreases by 10 seconds and the user is notified if their answer is correct or wrong with an alert below the multiple choice questions. Once the quiz comes to a complete the user must input their name so that it can be stored alongside the value of their score. 
  The score the user receives is the exact as the timer when the quiz comes to an end.
  The link to the repository is  https://github.com/laShawnfox/coder-quizer and the application is located at https://lashawnfox.github.io/coder-quizer/ .

# Usage
  The user should be able to click through the questions and receive immediate feedback on their choices. Once done the user will be able to view their score and re-take the quiz if they choose to do so.
